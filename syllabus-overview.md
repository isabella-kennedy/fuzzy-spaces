# Syllabus Overview: Fuzzy Spaces Studio

**Thesis:** Fuzzy Spaces: Remixing models and design methodologies through quantum literacy  
**Author:** Isabella Kennedy

## Course Description

This studio explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, quantum literacy, and architectural precedent. Students will engage with the concept of "Fuzzy Space"—a condition where the rigid boundaries of classical representation (plan, section, elevation) are dissolved into a probabilistic "latent space" of design potential.

Using the **xFigura.ai** platform, students will learn to "remix" architectural history. The course reframes the role of the architect from a solitary creator to a "DJ" or "Turntablist" of form—one who samples, loops, filters, and sequences existing cultural material to generate novel spatial conditions.

## Pedagogical Framework

The course is structured around three theoretical pillars derived from Vera Bühlmann's work on *Quantum Literacy*:

### 1. Quantum Optics & The Latent Image
* **Theory:** Understanding the image not as a static representation, but as a field of data (pixels, vectors, semantics) that can be manipulated.
* **Application:** Deconstructing Malevich's Suprematist compositions to find the "bassline" (structure) and "high frequencies" (detail/light).

### 2. Hybrid Language
* **Theory:** Moving beyond the separation of natural language and formal code. In architecture, this manifests as the collapse of projection systems.
* **Application:** Creating drawings that are simultaneously plan, elevation, and axonometric, mirroring the "hybrid" nature of quantum superposition.

### 3. The Impersonal Voice
* **Theory:** Science and nature speak through codes that are public and shareable, rather than private and subjective.
* **Application:** Using musical structure (the "tic-tic" grid of electronic music) to organize architectural time and space, removing the arbitrary "hand" of the designer.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1.  **Conceptualize Latent Space:** Articulate the relationship between 2D pixel data and 3D spatial potential.
2.  **Operate AI Tools:** Demonstrate proficiency in xFigura.ai for image-to-model generation and prompt engineering.
3.  **Analyze Precedent:** Critically deconstruct architectural canons (Malevich, Scarpa) into component "samples."
4.  **Design through Sampling:** Create coherent spatial propositions by "remixing" diverse inputs rather than modeling from a tabula rasa.

## Schedule & Deliverables

| Phase | Topic | Key Activity | Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1-2** | **Deconstruction** | Reading Bühlmann; Analyzing Malevich | Collage Input; Assignment 1 Final |
| **Week 3-4** | **Hybridization** | Analyzing Castelvecchio; "Beat-matching" plans | Hybrid Drawing; Assignment 2 Final |
| **Week 5-6** | **Sequencing** | Music Analysis; "Tic-Tic" Grid mapping | Urban Intervention; Assignment 3 Final |

## Evaluation Criteria

*   **Rigour of Sampling:** How thoughtfully were the original references analyzed and deconstructed?
*   **Legibility of the Remix:** Can we trace the "bassline" (structure) and "filters" (details) in the final output?
*   **Control of the Tool:** Does the student demonstrate agency over the AI, or are the results purely accidental?
*   **Theoretical Alignment:** Does the work reflect the concepts of Quantum Literacy and Impersonal Voice?
