## Overview

This repository serves as the digital companion and pedagogical framework for the Master's Thesis **"Fuzzy Spaces: Remixing models and design methodologies through quantum literacy."**

The central inquiry of this research is: *How can architecture students rapidly discover and remix novel 3D design ideas using AI tools, specifically xFigura, in a manner that aligns with studio pedagogy rather than disrupting it?*

Isabella Kennedy frames the architectural design process through the metaphor of **DJ-ing**:
- **Sampling / Turntablism:** Canonical works (e.g., Malevich, Scarpa, Hadid) are treated as "tracks" to be cut, looped, and remixed.
- **Latent Space as Bassline:** The deep, underlying structural grid and stereotomic mass of an image or model.
- **Filters & FX:** Circulation, light, and detailed tectonic elements that "cut through" the bassline like high-pass filters.

## Core Concepts

This curriculum is built upon the theoretical framework of **Quantum Literacy**, adapted from the work of Vera Bühlmann. It posits a coding literacy that merges natural language with formal code, allowing nature and design to speak with a public, "impersonal" voice—moving beyond the singular genius of the author.

### The Three Rungs of the Design Ladder

1. **Quantum Optics (Latent Space):**
   Identifying hidden patterns and relationships in images and forms. Moving from the visible surface to the underlying "code" or structure.
   
2. **Hybrid Language:**
   Dissolving the distinction between orthographic modes. Mixing plan, section, elevation, axonometric, and isometric views into a single, simultaneous reading.

3. **Public, Impersonal Voice:**
   Utilizing "tic-tic code"—a song structure grid—to sequence urban interventions. This shifts the design from a personal sketch to a shared, structural logic.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to mirror the progression of the studio assignments:

## Getting Started

### For Instructors
1. **Review the Theory:** Start with `docs/00_thesis-summary.md` and `docs/01_quantum-literacy-primer.md`.
2. **Assign Readings:** Refer to `references/reading-list.md` for the required seminar texts.
3. **Deploy Assignments:** Direct students to the `assignments/` directory. Each folder contains a self-contained brief, learning objectives, and direct links to the xFigura.ai workspaces.

### For Students
1. **Follow the Sequence:** The assignments are designed to be completed in order (1 → 2 → 3).
2. **Access xFigura:** Use the provided Project Links in each assignment's README to access the pre-configured environments.
3. **Document Process:** This studio emphasizes the *methodology* of remixing as much as the final output. Document your "prompts" and "sampling" decisions.
