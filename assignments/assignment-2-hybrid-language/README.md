## Learning Objective
Use **Hybrid Language** to collapse the distinctions between drawing types. You will mix your Assignment 1 result (Plan/Elevation) with patterns from Carlo Scarpa's Castelvecchio to create a drawing that reads as Plan, Section, and Axonometric simultaneously.

## The Concept: Superposition
Quantum literacy allows us to hold conflicting states in our mind at once. In this assignment, we reject the "cut" of the section line. We want a "Fuzzy Space" where the floor might also be a wall, and the plan might also be a view.
*   **Beat-Matching:** Aligning the rhythm of your Malevich massing with the intricate detailing of Scarpa.

## Instructions

### 1. Pre-Processing (Beat-Matching)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Your result from Assignment 1.
    *   Plans/Photos of **Carlo Scarpa's Castelvecchio** (see `sample-inputs/castelvecchio-refs.md`).
*   **Overlay:** In Photoshop, overlay fragments of Castelvecchio onto your Malevich massing.
    *   *Align Circulation:* Match Scarpa's ramps/stairs to your "high-pass" paths.
    *   *Hybrid View:* Don't worry about correct perspective. Paste a section detail onto a plan view. This "glitch" is what the AI will resolve.

### 2. Mixing (The Mashup)
1.  Open the [xFigura Assignment 2 Workspace](https://xfigura.ai/designer?presistentid=6d7f1e93-7e38-46ef-b992-23b505fd392a).
2.  **Import:** Upload your Hybrid Collage.
3.  **Prompting:**
    *   *Commands:* "Castelvecchio concrete detail," "gold leaf trim," "axonometric plan hybrid," "multi-view composition."
    *   *Goal:* Ask the AI to resolve the conflicting perspectives into a single coherent object.
4.  **Iterate:** Look for moments where the AI creates a "spatial knot"—a place where 2D and 3D are indistinguishable.

### 3. Output
*   A single high-resolution image that functions as a "Hybrid Drawing."

## Deliverables
1.  **Hybrid Input Collage:** `sample-inputs/yourname_hybrid_collage.png`.
2.  **Final Output:** `sample-outputs/yourname_hybrid.png`.
3.  **Reflection:** Describe where the "beat-match" occurred. How did Scarpa change your Malevich plan?
