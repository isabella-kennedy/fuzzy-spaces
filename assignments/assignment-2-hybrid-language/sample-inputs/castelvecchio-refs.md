# Castelvecchio References

For Assignment 2, we look to Carlo Scarpa's **Castelvecchio Museum** as our "Sample B" track.

## Why Castelvecchio?
Scarpa's work is famously "layered." He does not demolish; he adds layers, cuts reveals, and creates "joints" between the old and the new. This is the perfect architectural analogue to **sampling** and **remixing**.

## Key Samples to Extract

1.  **The Cangrande Statue Setting**
    *   *Feature:* The cantilevered walkway, the separation of floor from wall.
    *   *Use for:* Breaking up your "Bassline" mass.

2.  **The Bridge/Stair Transitions**
    *   *Feature:* Asymmetrical stairs, floating treads, distinct material changes (stone to wood).
    *   *Use for:* "High-pass" circulation paths.

3.  **The Window Reveals**
    *   *Feature:* The "step" detail in the corners of windows/doors.
    *   *Use for:* Adding high-frequency noise/detail to blank surfaces.

## Task
Find high-resolution plans or photos of these specific moments. "Crop" them (sample them) and overlay them onto your Assignment 1 drawing.
