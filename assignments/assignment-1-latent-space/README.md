## Learning Objective
Understand **latent space** as the "deep structural grid" of a composition. You will remix a Malevich painting into an abstract plan or elevation, distinguishing between the "Bassline" (Stereotomic Mass) and "High-Pass Filters" (Circulation/Light).

## The Concept: Quantum Optics
In this phase, we learn to see the hidden relationships between form, color, and code. We move from the visible geometry of a painting to its underlying **latent data**.
*   **Bassline:** The heavy, foundational elements (Mass, Ground, Void).
*   **High-Pass Filters:** The fast, cutting elements (Light paths, Thin steel, Circulation).

## Instructions

### 1. Pre-Processing (The Sample)
*   **Source Material:** Choose one **Suprematist painting** by Kasimir Malevich (see `sample-inputs/malevich-painting-refs.md`).
*   **Analysis:** Identify the "Bassline" (the big shapes) and the "Filters" (the floating lines).
*   **Collage:** Create a simple high-contrast collage (digital or analog).
    *   Ensure the "Bassline" is distinct from the background.
    *   Overlay "Filters" as contrasting bands.
    *   *Tip:* Keep the orientation clear (Orthographic).

### 2. Mixing (The Turntable)
1.  Open the [xFigura Assignment 1 Workspace](https://xfigura.ai/designer?presistentid=10d642bf-6fe8-4ae9-8585-5d5eea6a4554).
2.  **Import:** Upload your collage as the Input Image.
3.  **Prompting:**
    *   *Positive Prompt:* Describe the Bassline material (e.g., "heavy concrete mass," "monolithic stone") and the Filter action (e.g., "cut by glass corridors," "etched with light").
    *   *Negative Prompt:* "Realistic photo, perspective distortion, messy, blurry."
4.  **Iterate:** Adjust the **Image Strength**.
    *   *Low Strength (<0.4):* The AI hallucinates new forms (Jazz).
    *   *High Strength (>0.7):* The AI sticks to your collage (Classical).
    *   *Sweet Spot (0.5-0.6):* The Remix.

### 3. Output
*   Export your favorite iteration as a 2D Image.
*   (Optional) Export the 3D Mesh if the depth map is convincing.

## Deliverables
1.  **Input Collage:** Save to `sample-inputs/yourname_collage.png`.
2.  **Final Output:** Save your best xFigura result to `sample-outputs/yourname_plan.png`.
3.  **Reflection:** A short text file explaining how you translated the painting's "bassline" into architectural mass.
