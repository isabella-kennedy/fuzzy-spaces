## Learning Objective
Shift from a personal sketch to an **Impersonal Voice** by developing a "Tic-Tic Code" (visual song structure). You will apply the structural logic of an electronic music track to your hybrid design to generate a large-scale **Urban Intervention**.

## The Concept: The Tic-Tic Grid
Bühlmann argues that nature speaks through impersonal codes. In music, the sequencer grid (the "tic-tic" of the drum machine) is an impersonal grid that organizes emotion.
*   **The Grid:** A 4/4 measure is not "creative" in itself—it is the structure that *allows* creativity.
*   **Impersonal Voice:** By following the grid, you remove your own arbitrary "I like this shape" decisions and replace them with "The grid dictates this density."

## Instructions

### 1. Pre-Processing (The Sequencer)
*   **Select a Track:** Choose an electronic music track (Techno, House, Ambient).
*   **Map the Structure:** Create a "Tic-Tic Diagram."
    *   *X-Axis:* Time (Intro -> Build -> Drop -> Outro).
    *   *Y-Axis:* Layers (Bass, Hi-Hats, Synth, Vocals).
*   **Translate to Space:**
    *   *Time = Distance:* The length of the building/site.
    *   *Layers = Program:* Bass is structure, Hi-Hats are fenestration, Synth is landscape.
*   **Overlay:** Apply this grid to your Assignment 2 Hybrid.

### 2. Mixing (The Drop)
1.  Open the [xFigura Assignment 3 Workspace](https://xfigura.ai/designer?presistentid=4dd30894-1ffd-4a11-9226-c54585b90229).
2.  **Import:** Your grid-mapped Hybrid composition.
3.  **Prompting:**
    *   Use prompts that imply **scale** and **urban context**.
    *   *Keywords:* "Urban intervention," "Public plaza," "Megastructure," "City block," "Aerial view."
4.  **Refinement:** This is the final project. Ensure the "Bassline" (Latent Space) and "Hybridity" (Superposition) are still visible, but now organized by the "Tic-Tic" (Impersonal Voice).

### 3. Output
*   A final Urban Intervention image or model.

## Deliverables
1.  **Tic-Tic Diagram:** `sample-inputs/song_structure.pdf` (Your mapping of the song).
2.  **Final Urban Intervention:** `sample-outputs/final_intervention.png`.
3.  **Reflection:** How did the song structure dictate your design decisions? Did it force you to do something you wouldn't have done manually?
