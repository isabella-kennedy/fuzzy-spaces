# The Workflow: Architecture as DJ-ing

This course uses the metaphor of the **DJ (Disc Jockey)** to explain the interaction with AI tools. This is not merely a stylistic choice, but a functional mapping of operations.

## The Turntable: xFigura.ai
Just as a turntable allows a DJ to manipulate the speed, direction, and sound of a record, **xFigura.ai** allows the architect to manipulate the "latent space" of an image.

## The Operations

| DJ Term | Architectural Equivalent | xFigura Operation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sampling** | Selecting precedent (e.g., Malevich, Scarpa). | Importing a source image or collage. |
| **Bassline** | Stereotomic Mass / Structure / Grid. | Prompting for "heavy," "concrete," "mass," "foundation." |
| **High-Pass Filter** | Circulation / Light / Tectonics. | Prompting for "etched," "light paths," "steel," "glass," "voids." |
| **Beat-Matching** | Aligning scales and rhythms of two different projects. | Overlaying a plan onto a site map; aligning the grid of Scarpa with Malevich. |
| **Looping** | Repetition of architectural elements (colonnades, bays). | Iterating a generation with high consistency; feedback loops. |
| **The Drop** | The moment of spatial release or intensity (The Urban Intervention). | The final 3D realization of the sequenced design. |

## The Workflow Diagram

1.  **Input (The Crate):** Gather references. Malevich paintings, Scarpa drawings, Electronic tracks.
2.  **Pre-Processing (The Mix):** Create a digital collage.
    *   Extract the "Bassline" (mass).
    *   Overlay the "Highs" (circulation).
3.  **Processing (The Deck):** Import to xFigura.
    *   Prompting: Describe the material qualities of the bassline and the action verbs of the circulation.
    *   *Example Prompt:* "A massive concrete bunker structure (bassline) cut through by delicate steel walkways and light shafts (high-pass), isometric view."
4.  **Output (The Set):** Export 2D hybrid drawings and 3D geometries.
