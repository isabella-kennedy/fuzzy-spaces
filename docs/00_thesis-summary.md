# Thesis Summary

**Title:** Fuzzy Spaces: Remixing models and design methodologies through quantum literacy  
**Author:** Isabella Kennedy

## Problem Statement

Contemporary architectural pedagogy often struggles to integrate rapid AI generation tools in a way that reinforces, rather than undermines, deep design thinking. Students may treat AI as a "black box" magic trick, producing images without understanding the underlying spatial logic.

This thesis proposes a new methodology: treating the AI latent space as a "turntable" for architectural remixing. By framing design as a process of **sampling** (selection), **filtering** (refinement), and **sequencing** (composition), the project restores agency to the student designer.

## The "Fuzzy Space"

"Fuzzy Space" refers to the probabilistic nature of the AI's latent space. Unlike a CAD model, where a line is strictly a line, the latent space holds a cloud of possibilities. A "fuzzy" space is one that is not yet collapsed into a single definition—it is simultaneously plan and section, structure and ornament, until the designer "collapses" the wave function through prompting and control.

## Key Contributions

1.  **The DJ Metaphor:** A pedagogical tool that makes abstract AI concepts accessible. "Bassline" maps to massing/structure; "High-Pass Filters" map to circulation/fenestration.
2.  **Quantum Literacy in Design:** Adapting Vera Bühlmann's philosophy to architectural education, emphasizing the public, code-based nature of contemporary creativity.
3.  **The xFigura Workflow:** A demonstrated pipeline for moving from 2D collage inputs to 3D spatial outputs without losing the "ghosts" of the original references.
