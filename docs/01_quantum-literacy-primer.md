# Quantum Literacy Primer

*Based on the work of Vera Bühlmann and adapted for the "Fuzzy Spaces" thesis.*

## What is Quantum Literacy?

In the context of this studio, **Quantum Literacy** is defined as a coding literacy that does not separate natural language from formal code. It is the ability to read and write the "codes" of nature and information systems, giving them a public, impersonal voice.

Traditionally, architecture has often been taught as the expression of a singular "genius"—a private voice. Quantum literacy shifts this to a public voice, where the designer operates as an interpreter of shared codes.

## Key Concepts for the Studio

### 1. Quantum Optics (The "Bassline")
In physics, quantum optics deals with the behavior of light at the level of individual photons. In our design methodology, this translates to seeing the **latent patterns** in an image. 
*   **The "Bassline":** The low-frequency information in an image—the broad strokes, the mass, the gravity. In architecture, this is the stereotomic mass, the ground, the heavy walls.
*   **The "High-Pass Filter":** The high-frequency information—the edges, the noise, the texture. In architecture, this is the circulation, the light shafts, the intricate details.

### 2. Hybrid Language (Superposition)
Quantum mechanics allows for **superposition**—a particle being in multiple states at once. 
*   In architectural drawing, we enforce strict separation: a plan is not a section. 
*   In "Fuzzy Spaces," we embrace the hybrid. An AI model (like xFigura) can "see" an image as both a top-down map and a frontal elevation simultaneously. We use this ambiguity to generate novel forms that defy standard projection.

### 3. Impersonal Voice (The "Tic-Tic" Code)
Bühlmann argues that code gives nature an "impersonal voice." It is not the voice of the author, but the voice of the system.
*   We adopt the **"Tic-Tic" grid**—the mechanical, quantized grid of electronic music sequencers—as our structural logic. 
*   By submitting our design decisions to this external, impersonal grid, we step away from "taste" and "style" and move towards structural coherence and rhythmic sequence.
